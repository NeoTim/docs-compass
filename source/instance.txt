MongoDB Instance

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Once connected to a MongoDB instance, the home |home| on the left hand
pane provides details regarding the MongoDB instance, such as:

- the connection name if the connection is a favorite connection or "My
  Cluster" otherwise.

- the deployment type (standalone, replica set, sharded cluster). If
  the deployment is a replica set and the replica set name is specified
  in the connection window, the number of replica set members will also
  be displayed.

- the hostname and port, as well as the version of MongoDB.

From the instance home, you can access:

- The :ref:`Databases <database-tab>` tab to view and manage the
  databases in the deployment, and

- The :ref:`Server Performance <performance-tab>` tab to view real time
  server stats. *Not Available in Compass Community Edition*
